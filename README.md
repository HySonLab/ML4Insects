# EPGS (EPG Segmentation) - A library for EPG signal analysis of pierce-sucking insects

Electrical penetration graph (EPG) is a technique used to study the feeding behavior of aphids on plants. In this technique, the aphid and plant are made part of an electrical circuit, which is completed when aphid mouthparts penetrate plant tissue. When the aphid stylet is inserted intercellularly, the voltage is positive and when inserted intracellularly, the voltage is negative. Waveforms in EPG have been correlated to specific aphid feeding behaviors by stylectomy followed by microscopy of the plant tissue to determine the approximate location of the stylet as well as observing aphid head movement, posture, and muscle dynamics. EPG is well established and has been widely used to study the mechanisms of plant virus transmission by aphids, the effect of resistant and susceptible lines on aphid feeding behaviors, and to better our understanding of the mechanisms that aphids use to continuously drink from the phloem.
